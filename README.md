# Poject Simplefolio

- This project was created as part of a coding bootcamp.
- I created this project on the first day we learned about react
- The learning objective of the project:
- Create a React app with the help of the terminal
- Understand the basic principles of React by:

1. structuring and organizing a React page (Where are redundancies? Where can I reuse a component?)
2. creating multiple components (modular structure)
3. styling multiple components
